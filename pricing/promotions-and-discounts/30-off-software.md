**1. Generate a New Subscription**

Subscriptions created through the billing page bundle system will automatically have a 30% discount applied, as long as your [server subscription is still active](30-off-software.md#terms-and-details).

**2. Set your Community ID**

Once you've created your new subscription, be sure to apply the subscription to the specific community in the CAD, CMS, or Radio's billing portal!

#### Existing Subscriptions

Users with an existing subscription can click `Bundle and Save` on the subscription to apply the discount.

Once linked the discount is shown in the billing panel. The discount is automatically applied as long as your [server subscription is still active](30-off-software.md#terms-and-details).
