## VPS Server Backups

### What are VPS Backups?

Sonoran Servers includes free weekly backups with all VPS purchases, stored on-site for data loss or server issues.

Upgrade to daily backups, more restore options, and self-service backups for $10/month extra. Paid plans also recieve higher priority and faster speeds.

### How Much Do VPS Backups Cost?

VPS Backups plans are straightforward and very cost-effective.

\* To prevent spam, self-service backups and restores are limited to two per month. Open a ticket with [customer support](https://sonoranservers.com/contact.php) in the need of additional restores.&#x20;

\*\* Backup Rotation is the maximum number of backups that are kept at any given time for a VPS, subsequent backups override the oldest backup.

### 5. Wait for the Restore to complete

A progress bar will display the current restore progress. If you refresh the page or close the window, you may view the progress under the `Tasks and Logs` Tab.&#x20;

Restores typically take 1-3 hours before the VPS is fully available for use, restore/backup times are affected by the current usage of our network at any given point in time.
