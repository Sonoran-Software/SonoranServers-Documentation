## VPS Server Backups

### What are VPS Backups?

Sonoran Servers VPS products are automatically backed up weekly to our on-site network storage. These backups are available to you for a fee in the event of lost data or a compromised server. You can opt into a paid Backup Plan that will upgrade your backups to daily backups with 1 free restore each month. This paid backup plan costs $10 per month on top of your VPS cost.

### How Much Do VPS Backups Cost?

VPS Backups plans are straightforward and very cost-effective.

| Plan                          | 1st Restore     | Additional Restores |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| **Weekly Backups - FREE**     | $50 per Restore | $50 per Restore     |
| **Daily Backups - $10/month** | FREE            | $15                 |

### How do I upgrade my Backup Plan?

#### 1. Purchase Backup Plan at VPS initial purchase

### Can I Restore my data without a paid Backup Plan?

Yes, you can. If you have not opted for the $10 Daily Backup plan, please [reach out to Support](https://sonoranservers.com/contact.php) to start the order for a restore. Restores outside of our paid backup plan are subject to a $50 fee per restore.

### Can I get additional Restores?

Yes. If you have a paid Backup plan, you are entitled to 1 free restore per month. If you need additional restores, you will need to reach out to our support team to purchase additional restores at the price of $15 per restore.

Be prepared to tell the support team member which backup you would like to restore to, they will need to process the restore on your behalf.
