## Purchase Your Game Server

Sonoran Servers makes it easy to estimate what server specifications to pay for. Utilizing the game developer recommended hardware specifications we recommend based on the number of players you want to support on your game server.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The player slots are not limited unless limited by the game developers, the slot count is just used to recommend a game server config for you. You may adjust the specifications however you would like.
{% endhint %}

### 1. Select the Game Mode

Go to the [game server configurator](https://sonoranservers.com/gameserver/#/) on our website and select BeamNG.Drive as the game you would like to purchase a game server for.

### How to Connect to your Server

What's that? Don't know how to connect to your BeamMP server? Why let's show you!

First, make sure you have Installed BeamMP, you can find out more here. Once installed launch BeamMP from the start menu.

Next, I suggest clicking on the IP address shown in your Game Server Console window to copy the IP.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (89).png>)

In BeamNG.drive, click "**Play**", then "**Multiplayer**". If you set your server to `Private = false` in your Server.cfg file, then your server should show on the server list.

If you have trouble finding it, go ahead and direct connect!

Click "**Direct Connect**" from the left-hand sidebar, then click the "**Paste from Clipboard**" button to paste the IP you copied earlier.

![Direct Connect to your BeamMP Server](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

Finally, click "**Connect**" to join your BeamMP server! You should join your game server without any issues.

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to a bug, dedicated IP addresses purchased with game servers from us will not work for the BeamMP server list. You must direct connect in order to join your server. Joining from the server list will either join another server or not connect at all.

We are waiting on the BeamMP developers to implement a fix on their end [https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/issues/57](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/issues/57)
