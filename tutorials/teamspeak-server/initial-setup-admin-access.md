3\. Follow the prompts to checkout and pay for your TeamSpeak server. Once you checkout a series of emails will be sent to you including your TeamSpeak server information.

## Gain Server Admin Access

{% hint style="info" %}
This is **ONLY** applicable to newly setup TeamSpeak servers. Once Server Admin Access has been claimed the first time, you will need an existing Server Admin to give you roles or generate a new Server Admin Token. You can find out how to do that [here](generate-server-role-tokens.md).
{% endhint %}

1\. Check your email for an email with the subject `New TeamSpeak Server Information`. It will contain a "Token", this is needed in the next step.

2\. Open your TeamSpeak 3 Client, if you do not already have it you can download it [here](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads/).

3\. Click `Connections` and then `Connect` in the menus at the top.

4\. Fill in the Connection URL from the email into the `Server Address` field and enter a nickname for you to be seen as while connected to TeamSpeak in the `Nickname` field. Then click `Connect` at the bottom.

5\. After your client connects to the server, you should see a prompt to "Use Privilege Key". This is where you will enter your "Token" from your email. Then click `OK`.
