## How do I activate Sonoran Shield?

The Alpha version of Sonoran Shield currently requires a:&#x20;

1. Sonoran Software account and&#x20;
2. Sonoran Servers VPS or Dedicated Server Subscription

### 1. Register an Account

Create and access your account at [account.sonoransoftware.com](https://account.sonoransoftware.com)

### 2. Link your Sonoran Servers Account

On the welcome page or sidebar, select `Sonoran Shield`

Enter your sonoranservers.com login credentials.

### 3. Create your Firewall Rules and Application Filters

It is **recommended** to do the following in order to stop network attacks with Sonoran Shield:

1. Block all unused ports using a "block-all" rule
2. Allow traffic to used ports, allowing all traffic to ports used by your users and whitelisting specific IPs for management ports (such as Remote Desktop or SSH ports)
3. Apply Application Filtering rules to all ports that are open based on their specific application

The following linked guides walk you through how to complete each of the above steps:

* [Block unused ports and open required ones](firewall-rules.md)
* [Apply application-specific filters](application-filters.md)
* [View your attack history](attack-history.md)
