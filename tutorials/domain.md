# Domain

## Transferring a Domain Out

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that you've turned off the `Registrar Lock` in your Sonoran Servers panel prior to initiating the transfer.
{% endhint %}

If you wish to transfer your Sonoran Servers domain to another host, you will need an EPP authorization code in order to process the transfer.&#x20;

Due to limitations with our registrar, it is not possible to get this code directly from the Sonoran Servers panel at this time.&#x20;

As such, you will need to open a [support ticket](https://support.sonoransoftware.com/) with us where you must request the EPP Code. We will then process this request, and your EPP code will be sent to your email.
