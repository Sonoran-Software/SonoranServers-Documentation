# Purchasing and Getting Started

## 1. Select Your Plan

Navigate to [https://sonoranservers.com](https://sonoranservers.com) and select Virtual Private Servers (VPS) or Dedicated Servers

We offer several server configurations depending on your needs. For most gaming servers, we recommend the Windows 4-6 or 4-8 VPS plan. However, you can always upgrade your vCPU, RAM, and SSD storage resources at any time. Dedicated Servers are available for when you require more power to run many applications at once.

## 2. Configure Your Server

After selecting your plan, there will be more options available to configure your VPS.\
You can add on additional RAM or SSD storage as needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Dedicated Servers vary a little bit but follow very similar steps, due to the nature of dedicated servers, configuration options are more limited.
{% endhint %}

Configure Server:

* **Hostname:** This is just a label for your VPS. You can put your name, your community name, or something else.
* **Root Password** - For Windows VPS servers, the password must contain **at least 3** of the following:
  * One Uppercase Letter
  * One Lowercase Letter
  * One Number
  * One Symbol (!, $, #, %)
* **NS1/NS2:**
  * For NS1 and NS2, simply type in `ns1` and `sn2`
