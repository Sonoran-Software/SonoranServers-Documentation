# Domain Name Transfers

After May 15th, 2025 the Sonoran Servers DNS management panel for domains will no longer be available. Your domain will continue to function as normal until the expiration date. **Domains will not be automatically renewed**.

Our team will be contacting all domain customers to help with the following migration options:

1. Transfer your domain to a Namecheap account.
2. Transfer your domain to another domain registrar.
   1. Note: Registrar transfers outside of Namecheap require a renewal fee (one year of ownership) that will extend the current expiration date.

You may request either of these transfer methods on our [support portal](https://support.sonoransoftware.com).
