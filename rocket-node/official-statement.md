# Official Statement

### Statement

I wanted to share an important update with you about Sonoran Servers—one that marks an exciting new direction for our team, even if it comes with some bittersweet news. After a lot of consideration, we've decided to phase out our server hosting services and transition Sonoran Servers customers to Rocket Node Hosting. While it's been a measurable success and a solid part of our business, we’ve spent the last year realizing it's time to shift our focus back to what we do best.

Over time, we’ve realized that trying to do it all limits our ability to excel at what we do best: building innovative software. Rising costs from data centers, network fees, and licensing, combined with the highly competitive hosting market, have made it clear that hosting isn’t where we can deliver the most impact.

Customers will receive a 45-day notice to prepare for the transition. Those who cancel early will get [prorated refunds](information-faq.md#im-migrating-but-still-have-some-time-left-on-my-sonoran-servers-subscription.-can-i-get-a-partial-r), [ongoing software discounts](information-faq.md#i-have-a-30-100-software-discount-what-happens), [managed VPS migrations](information-faq.md#how-do-i-migrate-my-vps-to-rocket-node), and [one-click installations](information-faq.md#how-do-i-install-sonoran-cad-cms-and-radio-on-rocket-node) for Sonoran CAD, CMS, and Radio. Our [support team is available](https://support.sonoransoftware.com) 7 days/week to ensure this transition is as easy as possible for your community. You can find all the details in our FAQ: [Transition FAQ](information-faq.md).

This isn’t just about cutting costs—it’s about sharpening our focus. Stepping away from hosting lets us invest more in our core strengths, driving innovation, faster growth, and better value for our customers. Meanwhile, transitioning customers will enjoy cost savings, seamless installations, and access to faster, modern hardware.

Thank you for being part of this journey and for your continued support as we move forward into this next chapter.

### TL;DR:

* We’re transitioning Sonoran Servers customers to Rocket Node.
  * Customers will save money with our new partnered host, along with newer hardware and faster speeds.
  * Easy, automatic installation for our software products on the new platform.
  * Our support team is standing by to ensure a smooth transition for your community.
* We're excited to focus more on software with exciting updates ahead!
