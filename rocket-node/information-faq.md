## Payment, Discounts, and Refunds

### I have a software bundle discount, what happens?

<details>

<summary>I have a 30-100% Software Discount, what happens?</summary>

Existing Sonoran Servers customers have received bundle discounts on Sonoran CAD, CMS, and Radio. All Sonoran Servers VPS, dedicated, and game panel hosting services will end on **May 15th, 2025**.

As a thank-you, we're offering a **15% recurring discount** on CAD, CMS, or Radio to all active subscribers—**regardless of your new hosting provider**. To claim, just [open a support ticket](https://support.sonoransoftware.com) **before May 15th, 2025**.

_Offer valid through May 15th and only applies to current subscriptions that still have the original hosting discount. Canceled or downgraded plans are not eligible. After May 15th, 2025 all remaining bundle discounts will be removed._

This ensures your community continues to enjoy discounted Sonoran Software—now with saving even more with faster and cheaper hosting from Rocket Node.
